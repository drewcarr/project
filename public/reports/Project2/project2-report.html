        <h1>Meeting Log</h1>
        Most meetings happened informally throughout the two weeks of the project via Groupme. Julian began again with setting up the foundation for what was needed programming wise around Oct. 17th. He kept us updated on the progress.
        <br /><br />
        Afterwards more work was done to finish up the code and help with bugs by Alexandra and Drew in cooperation with Julian across Oct. 19th - 23rd
        <br /><br />
        Report and logging happened throughout the course of the project by the remaining members.
